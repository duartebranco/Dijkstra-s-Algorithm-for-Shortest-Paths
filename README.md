# Dijkstra-s-Algorithm-for-Shortest-Paths
This program implements Dijkstra's algorithm to find the shortest path between nodes in a graph on the TI-84 graphing calculator using Python. It allows users to input the number of nodes and the weights between pairs of nodes, and then calculates the shortest path and distance between a specified source and destination node. The program handles up to 26 nodes and infinite weights are denoted by 'i'.
